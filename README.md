# Sarsa, Q-learning and Expected Sarsa
<b>Gabriele Prato, McGill University</b><br/>

In this notebook, we will be implementing and comparing Sarsa, Q-learning and Expected Sarsa on the Cliff Walking problem described in the class textbook [1].

Example 6.6 will be implemented as well as the Sarsa, Q-learning and Expected Sarsa algorithms.<br/>
